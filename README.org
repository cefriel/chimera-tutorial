* Chimera YAML

Example of a Chimera [[./src/main/resources/routes/my-route.camel.yaml][route]] built using the Apache Camel YAML DSL.  The
route in the example creates an empty graph, adds the RDF triples from
the [[./src/main/resources/routes/test.ttl][test.ttl]] file to the graph and then dumps it to a file called
/dump.ttl/.
