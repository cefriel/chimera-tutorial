* Chimera YAML Example

This repository provides an example of how to write and deploy a **Chimera route** using the **Apache Camel YAML DSL** within a **Java project**.

** Overview

This example demonstrates how to define a Chimera route in Camel YAML DSL that:

1. Creates an empty RDF graph
2. Loads RDF triples from a file named `test.ttl`
3. Writes (dumps) the resulting graph to a file named `dump.ttl`

** Structure

- [[./src/main/resources/routes/my-route.camel.yaml][my-route.camel.yaml]]: Defines the Chimera route using the YAML DSL
- [[./src/main/resources/routes/test.ttl][test.ttl]]: Contains the input RDF triples
- dump.ttl: Output file generated by the route
